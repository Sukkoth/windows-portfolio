Ionic is an open source UI toolkit for building performant, high-quality mobile apps using web technologies â€” HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” with integrations for popular frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue. It is used with Capacitor. Capacitor is a cross-platform native runtime that makes it easy to build performant mobile applications that run natively on iOS, Android, and more using modern web tooling. Representing the next evolution of Hybrid apps, Capacitor creates Web Native apps, providing a modern native container approach for teams who want to build web-first without sacrificing full access to native SDKs when they need it. (these texts are from their docs). I have tried installing the app on android but left the whole thing since it is better to use either Flutter or React Native for mobile apps.",
