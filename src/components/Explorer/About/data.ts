    body: "I have spent 5 years in campus and I have learned a lot of things both academically and spiritually. It has laid foundations for my coding and spiritual life. I started my coding journey at campus even though it was a bit rough and not satisfactory. But I at least got the foundations to start it and after campus, I have dedicated myself to learning and growing my skills. Campus was also the place where I really got serious about my spiritual life. I have engaged in students' fellowship and Bible Study groups. I am so grateful about this aspect of my life at campus. Because I know now that I am a sinner who does not deserve to live with God but is living with him only because of His mercy and grace. This is the most essential part of my life now.",
