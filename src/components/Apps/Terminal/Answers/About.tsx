      <p>
        I am a full stack developer with over 4 years of experience. I work with
        TypeScript, Express, Next.js, and NestJS to build reliable web
        applications and backend systems. I also have strong experience working
        with microservices, queues (BullMQ with Redis), and databases like
        ScyllaDB and CockroachDB. I’ve built full systems —frontend dashboards,
        APIs, and microservices—for high-traffic and high-volume platforms. I
        write clean, well-structured code and focus on building things that work
        fast and scale well. I can work on both frontend and backend, and I’m
        used to handling real-world problems, from database design to system
        architecture.I am an Evangelical Christian, who is saved by God's
        unwavering mercy and grace.
